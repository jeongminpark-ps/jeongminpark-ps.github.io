Welcome! 

I am a Ph.D candidate in the Department of Politics at Princeton University, and a Graduate Fellow at Princeton Institute of International and Regional Studies (PIIRS). I study the distributional consequences of international conflict, with a substantive focus on historical political economy, state capacity, and gender. You can see the latest version of my CV [here](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/9s4psiqnzqsm4w3mt45q9/Jeongmin_s_CV.pdf?rlkey=h1olbw76nhxbiy65c4rndblj2&st=f64wse2k&dl=0):

My dissertation investigates why governments impose gender-based discriminatory labor regulations following mass warfare, reversing women's wartime employment gains. I argue that postwar governments deliberately undermine women's labor market competitiveness to facilitate veteran employment. I test this argument in the context of interwar England and Wales, utilizing original microdata documenting Home Office responses to thousands of employer requests after the First World War for exemptions from the 1901 British Factory and Workshop Act, which restricted the working conditions of adult women.

My work has been published at the *International Studies Quarterly*. I am on the 2024-25 Job Market. You can reach me at jp49@princeton.edu.
