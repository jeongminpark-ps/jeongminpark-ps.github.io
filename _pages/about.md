Welcome! 

I am a Ph.D candidate in the Department of Politics at Princeton University, and a Graduate Fellow at Princeton Institute of International and Regional Studies (PIIRS).

I study the distributional consequences of international conflict, with a substantive focus on historical political economy, state capacity, and gender. My dissertation examines how governments selectively impose discriminatory labor policies targeting women in response to veteran grievances. My work has been published at the *International Studies Quarterly*. I am on the 2024-25 Job Market. You can reach me at jp49@princeton.edu.
